# Grocery Online Shopping App: Microservices Architecture

## Introduction

The Grocery Online Shopping App is transitioning to a microservices architecture to enhance its scalability, flexibility, and overall development lifecycle. By adopting this approach, our team can deploy, update, and scale the application's components independently, allowing us to quickly respond to market demands and technological advancements.

## Microservices Architecture Overview

The application is divided into several key microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the app's functionality. This modular approach ensures that each service is lightweight, focused on a particular task, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Core Microservices:

- **Customer Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product Service**: Manages product inventory, descriptions, and categories.
- **shopping Service**: Handles order placement, tracking, and history.


## Technologies Used

- **Containerization**: Docker is used to create containerized environments for each microservice, ensuring consistency and portability.
- **API Gateway**: A unified entry point is implemented for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate services and simplifying the client-side integration.
- **Service Discovery**: This mechanism enables services to find and communicate with each other in a dynamic environment, allowing for seamless inter-service communication.
- **Distributed Monitoring and Logging**: Tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack are utilized for monitoring the health and performance of services, as well as aggregating logs for troubleshooting and performance tuning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up and run the Grocery Online Shopping App locally, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Docker: Used for containerizing the microservices.
- Node.js: Needed for local development and running the services.
